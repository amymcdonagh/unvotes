# The purpose of this step is to load, clean and filter the United Nations Dataset by utilizing the dplyr package and then 
# summarize into smaller more interpretable units. 

# Download dataset from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/file.xhtml
load("~/Downloads/UNVotesPublished.RData")

# Load dplyr package
library(dplyr)

# Print dataset
View(x)

# Remove unnecessary rows
drop <-c("member")
x
df$member <- NULL
votes <- c("rcid", "session", "vote", "ccode")
newdata <- x[votes]
newdata

# Filter for votes that are only "yes", "no" and "abstain"
newdata%>%
  filter (vote <= 3)

# Add a year column
newdata %>%
  filter(vote <= 3) %>%
  mutate(year = session + 1945)

# Install Country Code Package
install.packages("countrycode")
library(countrycode)

# Convert country code
countrycode(100, "cown", "country.name")

# Add column within the mutate
votes_processed <- newdata %>%
  filter(vote <= 3)%>%
  mutate(year = session + 1945,
  country = countrycode(ccode, "cown", "country.name"))

# Print new votes processed
votes_processed

# Find total and percent of "yes" votes

            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

# Summarize by year

  group_by(year) %>%

          percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))
            
# Summarize by country: by_country
by_country <- votes_processed %>%
  group_by(country) %>%

# Print the by_country dataset

# Sort in ascending order of percent_yes
